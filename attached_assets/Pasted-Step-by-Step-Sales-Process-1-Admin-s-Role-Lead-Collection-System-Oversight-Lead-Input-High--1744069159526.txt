Step-by-Step Sales Process
	1.	Admin’s Role: Lead Collection & System Oversight
	•	Lead Input: High volume of sales leads are generated and entered manually by the admin.
	•	Unified Overview: All order tracking, approvals, and financials are managed via the admin pages.
	2.	Sales Team Workflow
	•	Dashboard Setup: Each salesperson has a personalized dashboard.
	•	Lead Claiming: Salespeople claim leads from a job postings page.
	•	Client Consultation & Order Formation: They contact clients and curate a list of desired products.
	•	Order Editing: Sales orders are editable on the orders page, while the admin can monitor and edit all orders.
	3.	Design Process
	•	Design Dashboard: Designers see a board that’s similar to the sales leads page, but exclusively for design jobs.
	•	Claiming & Deadline: Designers claim designs with a 3-day deadline to complete.
	•	Rate Management & Payouts: Each design has an associated rate (editable by admin) and all dashboards show pending payouts.
	•	Approval Process: Completed designs go to the admin dashboard for approval or revision.
	4.	From Design Approval to Manufacturing
	•	Client Consultation on Sizes: Once the design is approved, the salesperson consults with the client to finalize sizes.
	•	Transition to Manufacturing: The client’s order is then automatically sent to manufacturing.
	•	Invoice Generation: QuickBooks integration sends out an automated invoice to the client.
	5.	Manufacturing Workflow
	•	Manufacturer’s Dashboard: Displays detailed design orders so production can proceed without extra consultation.
	•	Cost Input & Billing: Manufacturers input the cost of goods, feeding into the admin’s pending bill system.
	6.	Order Tracking & Customer Visibility
	•	Tracking Page: The admin manages order tracking and displays real-time status updates for customers.
