To incorporate the Sales Process Guide into your existing site, create a dedicated, interactive page that outlines the entire order pipeline from lead acquisition to final delivery. This page will serve as a smart reference tool for salespeople, helping them track the current stage of each order and identify any pending actions. The process begins when a salesperson claims a lead from the Big Board, which automatically redirects them to the Order Creation page. There, they fill out a standard form and add necessary items before submitting the order to design. Once submitted, the order appears on the Unclaimed Designs page accessible by designers. When a designer claims the job, an automatic email is sent to the customer requesting item-specific descriptions. Once the customer submits the form, the designer has 72 hours to complete the front and back mockups for each item. The completed design is then submitted for admin review through the Pending Design Approvals page. If approved, a notification is sent to the salesperson, and the system unlocks the order for size input. The salesperson then clicks “Request Sizes,” triggering a customer form where they select sizes and quantities. After submission, the order enters the Pending Manufacturing Approval stage, where the admin selects a manufacturer, attaches relevant fabric and product cut details, and pushes the order to the manufacturer. The manufacturer receives the complete order—including designs, measurements, and materials—on their Manufacturing Orders page, inputs item costs, and updates production statuses in real time. Once production is complete, they upload tracking information and box contents, which notify the salesperson and customer via email and portal. Upon delivery, the order is marked complete, archived, and the system automatically generates payouts to the salesperson, designer, and manufacturer. This entire workflow will be clearly laid out as an interactive, clickable guide with visual progress indicators and hyperlinks to each corresponding page, making it easy for team members to navigate, understand their responsibilities, and ensure nothing is missed in the order lifecycle.
